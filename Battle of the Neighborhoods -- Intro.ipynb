    "The city of Toronto is geographically situated between Detroit and Montreal, two cities renowned for their respective jazz scenes. Toronto, despite its status as a major metropolitan center, has not achieved the same distinction as a hub for jazz artists and aficionados. This leaves room for opportunity to fill this niche. As such, in this project I have taken on the role of entrepreneur, seeking an ideal location within Toronto to open a new jazz club -- a bar/restaurant specializing in soul food cuisine, with an intimate aesthetic and performance space dedicated to providing an outlet for local musicians."
